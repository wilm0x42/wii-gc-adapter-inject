Riivolution is an on-the-fly game patcher for use with retail discs. It allows users to place content on their SD or USB devices, which will be read by the game during regular play.
Riivolution can be used for custom textures, music, levels, memory patches, game translations, and more.

Mini-FAQ - Updated online version: http://rvlution.net/riiv/FAQ

Q: Does Riivolution work with my "backups" or USB loaders?
A: No. And that's not a bug.

Q: Does Riivolution work with my PAL/NTSC/JAP Wii/game?
A: Yes.

Q: Does Riivolution work on my Wii U?
A: It does now! In vWii mode (it does not work with Wii U games) Riivolution can be run or installed through Smash Stack, other game exploits, or the Homebrew Channel if it's already installed.

Q: What IOS does it need installed?
A: Riivolution requires an updated IOS37; if you're on System Menu 4.2 or 4.3 you don't need to do anything.
   If it's not installed or the proper version it will be installed the first time Riivolution is run.
   Alternatively, you can also use NUSD or DOP-IOS to install it - with all patches disabled.

Q: Does Riivolution work with Game X?
A: I probably haven't played it, but yes, it should; try it. If it doesn't work, report it - some games known to reload IOS will require specific patches to work.
   Games that have specifically been tested include Fatal Frame 4, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Rock Band, among others.

Q: What does the "Install" button do?
A: It will install a Riivolution channel onto your System Menu for easy access. This can always be uninstalled.

Q: Can I use Ocarina / Gecko codes with it?
A: Normally, Riivolution just supports direct memory patches. However, Riivolution supports a patching method that can be used with the Gecko OS code handler.
   Read more about that here: http://rvlution.net/riiv/Ocarina_Codes

Q: Uhh, how do I use this?
A: As a user, you need to either download patch packages made by someone else or make your own.
   A basic template and packages for common games can be found here: http://rvlution.net/riiv/Patch_Templates

Q: Network support? Awesome, how do I use it?
